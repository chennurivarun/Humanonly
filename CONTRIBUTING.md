# Contributing to HumanOnly

Thanks for helping build human-first social infrastructure.

## First Steps
1. Read `MANIFESTO.md` and `GOVERNANCE.md`.
2. Read `docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Pick an issue labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
4. Open a draft PR early for feedback.

For detailed onboarding/review policy, see `docs/CONTRIBUTOR_EXPANSION.md`.

## Branch Naming
- `feat/<scope>-<short-name>`
- `fix/<scope>-<short-name>`
- `docs/<scope>-<short-name>`

## Contribution Tracks
- **Docs / Tests (first contribution-friendly):** keep PRs small and focused.
- **Product (API/UI):** link roadmap/issue, include tests for behavior changes.
- **Governance:** include rationale + migration impact; maintainer approval required.

## PR Requirements
- Clear problem statement
- Decision rationale
- Tests/docs updated
- No hidden behavior changes
- Explicit note when enforcement-sensitive paths are touched

## Safety
Do not implement features that bypass moderation audit logs or human override controls.
