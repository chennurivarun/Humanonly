# HumanOnly Manifesto

Built for human voices. Operated with AI discipline. Governed by humans.

We reject synthetic identity pollution in public discourse.
We support AI as infrastructure, never as human impersonation.

HumanOnly exists to defend authentic thought, accountable moderation, and civic trust online.
